# Simple Counter

This project is a simple counter showcasing increment and decrement functionality.

## Instructions

1. When a user clicks the increment button, the count increases by 1
2. When a user clicks the decrement button, the count decreases by 1
3. Bonus: Create an input field where a user types in a number. Increment/Decrement based on that number
4. When you're finished, update the readme with a `Running Our Test` section, outlining how to execute the test suite.

**Note: All JavaScript code must be test-driven!**
